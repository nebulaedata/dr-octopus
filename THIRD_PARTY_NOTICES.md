fd is offered upstream under MIT or Apache-2.0; this distribution uses the MIT
option. ripgrep is offered under MIT or the Unlicense; this distribution uses the
MIT option. Binary origins, platform versions and SHA-256 checksums are recorded
in packages/agent/infra/manifest.json.

License texts were retrieved from the corresponding fd, ripgrep and Pi release
tags, PCRE2's pcre2-10.45 tag, and the shadcn/ui and tanstack-skills default branches.
The fd MIT text was checked against both v10.3.0 and v10.4.2 and is identical.
The imported skill sources are also recorded in skills-lock.json.

## Icons and artwork

The maintainer identifies [iconfont](https://www.iconfont.cn/) as the download
source for model/provider icons and the former project logo. The current 3D
artwork in apps/web/public/brand/ was created using the former logo as a shape
and facial reference. These assets are excluded from the project's MIT grant.
Their respective authors and trademark owners retain their rights; use does not
imply endorsement.

Specific icon-set/item links, authors and redistribution terms have not yet been
provided. A platform download source alone does not establish redistribution
permission. Before public distribution, record the applicable item licenses and
attributions or replace assets whose permission cannot be established.

## Distribution and updates

The npm package and extracted runtime both include LICENSE and this notice. Preserve them when redistributing the application. Installed
npm dependencies retain the licenses supplied in their individual packages.

This inventory covers the identified bundled/adapted components; it is not a
complete audit of every transitive npm or statically linked native dependency.
When updating bundled tools, check the corresponding release artifacts and all
applicable dependency notices, not only the top-level project license.

### PCRE2

```text
PCRE2 License
=============

| SPDX-License-Identifier: | BSD-3-Clause WITH PCRE2-exception |
|---------|-------|

PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Releases 10.00 and above of PCRE2 are distributed under the terms of the "BSD"
licence, as specified below, with one exemption for certain binary
redistributions. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc" directory,
is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data in the
testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
the library is built.

Many other contributors have participated in the authorship of PCRE2. As PCRE2
has never required a Contributor Licensing Agreement, or other copyright
assignment agreement, all contributions have copyright retained by each
original contributor or their employer.

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.


EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
------------------------------------------

The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
PCRE2 independently.
